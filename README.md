# Gauge equivariant Attention

Welcome to my bachelor project "gauge equivariant Attention" :)

This is part of my work and shall serve as a Testing ground for future studies for myself and anyone how is
interested. 

My code of course is not limited to create Attention models so feel free to implement whatever might be useful.
Read the description of the configuration filed to find out how they can be used.
